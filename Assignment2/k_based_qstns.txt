pursuing/chasing vs seek

The pursuit behavior works pretty much the same way seek does, the only difference is that the pursuer will not seek the target itself, but its position in the near future.

-- example
public function pursuit(t :Boid) :Vector3D {
  T :int  = 3;
  futurePosition :Vector3D = t.position + t.velocity * T;
  return seek(futurePosition);
}
